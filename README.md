The project's main aim is to showcase the Azure deployment services and web app services understanding. It performs the regular CRUD operation of our tasks that we would like to do in groups.

# What are the Microsoft Azure web app services
Microsoft Azure offers a range of services for hosting web applications and managing databases. One common approach is to use Azure Web Apps for hosting your web application and Azure Database Services for managing your databases. Here's an overview of each service:

 ## Azure Web Apps (App Service):
Azure Web Apps, also known as Azure App Service, is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering for hosting web applications.
It supports multiple programming languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and more, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
You can deploy web applications, web APIs, and mobile app backends easily.
Azure Web Apps provide built-in scaling, load balancing, and automated deployment options for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
Supports custom domains, SSL certificates, and authentication options.

## Azure Database Services:
Azure offers several database services, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more.
Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service that's compatible with SQL Server.

## Deploy Your Web Application:
Create an Azure Web App and deploy your web application code to it. You can use tools like Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, or Azure CLI for deployment.
Database Selection:

Choose an appropriate Azure Database Service based on your application's needs. For example, if your application uses a relational database, you can select Azure SQL Database.

## Connection String:
Obtain the connection string for your database. This contains the necessary information to connect your web application to the database.

## Configure Connection:
Update your web application's configuration to include the connection string to the database. This is typically stored in an environment variable or an Azure App Configuration.

## SSH: 
SSH provides the web SSH console for Linux app code SSH involves two key components: the SSH client and the SSH server.
